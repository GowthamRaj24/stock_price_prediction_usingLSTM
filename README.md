# LSTM Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
## Overview
This repository contains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based stock price prediction model implemented using machine learning techniques. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction problems, making it a popular choice for stock price forecasting.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.6+
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored in the data directory. Ensure that your dataset follows the required format (e.g., CSV file with columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

## Model Architecture
The LSTM model architecture can be found in the lstm_stock_price_prediction.ipynb notebook or lstm_stock_price_prediction.py script. The model is trained on historical stock price data to predict future prices.

## Results
The results of the stock price predictions, along with evaluation metrics, can be found in the output of the Jupyter Notebook or printed in the console when running the Python script.
