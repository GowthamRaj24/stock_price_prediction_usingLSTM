# LSTM Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
## Overview
This repository contains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based stock price prediction model implemented using machine learning techniques. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction problems, making it a popular choice for stock price forecasting.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.6+
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras
